## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The name is Joshua Blaye, or JBlaye around here. 

I am yet another nerd, trying out various things, learning, and currently working as the 
AV Production Manager of Mission Hill Church - Chambersburg, so you may see some related things here and there.

While certainly no expert, I am considerably more comfortable in the world of AV than I am in the world of programming.
However, I aim to change that, as well as pursure various related things in the wonderful world of IT.

#### Things you may find here:
- Mission Hill related projects (those of which aren't classified *ðŸ™ƒ*)
- *Me* projects
- Hammers & wrenches
- A loose mystery wire, or two

#### How to reach me:
- Mission Hill related: joshb@missionhill.church
- General/Official: jvblaye@gmail.com
